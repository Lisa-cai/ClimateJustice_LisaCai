--Addressing wildfires solutions

1,Climate Change Mitigation

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Address the root causes of climate change through emissions reduction strategies to mitigate the conditions that contribute to more severe wildfires

2,Community Preparedness
Defensible Space: Encourage homeowners in wildfire-prone areas to create defensible spaces around their properties by removing flammable materials and maintaining a safe zone

3,Vegetation Management
Prescribed Burns: Controlled or prescribed burns can reduce excess vegetation that fuels wildfires. These controlled fires can be strategically set during periods of lower fire risk
